However, Micron failed even with mild OC due to hot temps. Hence I have to stick with +400 on M.CLK.\nOC ProcedureOpen up curve editorI’m a lazy guy and I don’t like gay lines. Therefore, I just open up MSI AfterBurner and jump right in onto the curve editor. \n\nDrag the whole curveIt is a lazy method because of how simple it is to be achieving what I wanted: \n\nBasically I just drag the point at .85V up to 1830-1850 ish, then Re-select and drag the points right to 1V to the bottom.

Now it turns out that it is partially true.\n\nWeird Reddit postLenovo Legion AMD users (5900HX&#x2F;5800H) w&#x2F; unlocked BIOS FREE Performance gains : LenovoLegion (reddit.com)\nThis reddit post talks about how he used XMP on the AMD counterpart while managing to un-brick using the unplug CMOS method.\nI was shocked at first glance because I was clear that all of us on Discord that tried BIOS UV&#x2F;OC and bricked did not manage to un-brick using the same method.\nIt was clear something was wrong.\nThen, mentioning how his failed to post and only showed a black screen, one comment caught my eyes and grabbed my mind.\nBased on our past experience, whenever the mobo feels not good about the timings&#x2F;OC&#x2F;UV you set, it does fail to post, and it does not show a black screen.\nTheoretically. on Intel versions of the Legion, there is one option called self-healing that is turned on by default. What is hilarious about this, is that the AMD one has this disabled by default.\nWhy? Because of the stupid self-healing probably. I thought so at the beginning.\nWell, it might not be true. Today I read the comment and was temped to give RAM OC and CMOS reset a try. (I don’t have to mess around with UV anymore because I figured out that -70mv is the best and I set that in BIOS already)\n\nMy RAM kitMy RAM kit is a crappy 3200MHz, CL22@1.2v one from Mushkin Essentials, an unknown sub-brand owned by Avant Tech., another non-popular American company. The manufacturer mainly uses SK Hynix chips due to its low costs while mine actually is using Micron chips.(SPD was empty somehow)\n\nLike I said, my kit came with Micron chips, with the following code printed clearly on the two-sided stick:0FE45D9ZFV\n2Rx8 chips are embedded on each sides, making it a 32Gx2 Dual Rank kit \nAccording to Micron documents, it means: 2020-10th_week-E-die-japan-china\nBy looking up in Micron’s database, it corresponds to this:\n\n\n\nPart Number\nFBGA Code\n\n\n\nMT40A2G8JC-062E:E\nD9ZFV\n\n\nMT40A2G8JC-062E | Micron Technologies, Inc\n\n\nGet hands dirtyLong story short, with the above information in mind, I know that this kit cannot be OC’ed much. I also know that I should disable self-healing  while at it.\nSo my first shot was 3200MHz, 18-19-19-36@1.35v. This simply did not post. Okay, so I unplugged the battery and CMOS battery. Pressed and hold the power button for like a min. Then plugged them back in. Pressed the button again, magically, it posted and booted right into Windows.\nYawn, I know this sucks, so I tried a milder OC, 3200MHz, 21-21-21-47@1.2v. This booted just fine. \nI guessed it could be pushed even more, thus next I tried 3200MHz, 19-20-20-40@1.35v. And it booted as well. However, as I ran a Cache and Mem test in AIDA64, the screen froze when it’s running the write test.\nI almost gave up, did another trial with 3400MHz, 22-22-52@1.35v. Surprisingly, it cripplingly booted and passed the AIDA64 benchmark!\n\nLatency almost dropped by 20%, and read&#x2F;write increased significantly as well.\n\nFinal resultsI wanted more so I eventually set it to 3400MHz, 20-20-50@1.35v.\n\nIt did not pass the TM5 stress test, but it seems fine so far. At least it ran the AIDA64 bench without any issues.\nI’ll check out games and Time spy later today.
